# products-app-bk

This repository contains the backend code for the products CRUD application. It is built with .NET 6 using the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern and provides a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with.

## Features

- **Create**: Users can add new products to the system by sending a POST request to the `/products` endpoint with the required data.

- **Read**: Users can retrieve a list of existing products by sending a GET request to the `/products` endpoint.

- **Update**: Users can update the details of a product by sending a PUT request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint with the updated data.

- **Delete**: Users can delete a product from the system by sending a DELETE request to the `/products/{id}` endpoint.

- **Validation**: Incoming requests are validated using the FluentValidation library to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to separate concerns and improve maintainability. Here's a brief overview of the main directories:

- `API`: Contains the API layer of the application, including controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and mapping them to the appropriate application services.

- `Application`: Implements the application layer of the DDD architecture. It is further organized into the following subdirectories:

  - `Commands`: Contains the command handlers responsible for executing business logic related to product creation, update, and deletion. This is where FluentValidation is used to validate the incoming command objects.

  - `Exceptions`: Contains custom exception types that can be thrown by the application layer to handle specific error scenarios.

  - `Products`: Contains the services and related components specific to the product domain. This includes DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used for transferring data between layers and services responsible for performing the required operations on products.

- `Domain`: Represents the domain layer of the application. It includes the core entities and repositories that define the business logic and data access contracts.

  - `Entities`: Contains the domain entities that encapsulate the core business concepts, such as the `Product` entity.

  - `Repositories`: Defines the interfaces for data access and repository implementations that provide the necessary methods to interact with the underlying data store.

- `Infrastructure`: Implements the infrastructure layer of the application, which handles data persistence and external integrations.

  - `Data`: Contains the database context and related entities for data persistence.

  - `Repositories`: Provides concrete implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

- `Migrations`: Contains the database migration scripts generated by Entity Framework Core to manage database schema changes.
## Getting Started

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have .NET 6 SDK installed on your machine.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.

4. Run the following command to restore the NuGet packages: `dotnet restore`

5. Set up the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.

6. Run the database migrations to create the necessary database schema: `dotnet ef database update`

7. Start the backend application: `dotnet run`

8. The backend API should now be running and accessible at the specified URL.

## Docker

To run the backend using Docker, you can use the following commands:

1. Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Build the Docker image for the backend by running the following command:
```
docker-compose build
```
4. Start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up
```
5. This will start the backend API and the PostgreSQL database container.

The backend API should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:5173
